/*This is the Edge Cover hypergraph solver

We represent a T-way testing problem with the Edge Cover

 * Input is a file of n lines. A line is a hyperedge
  * A hyperedge is a test that covers a number (m) of values
  * We choose a hyperedge that tests the most values. We then remove these tested values from other hyperedges
  * We end the algorithm when everything has been tested.
  *
  * This algorithm is greedy, but there is some randomness.
  * By picking a random edge when others are equal, we get different results.
  * Spark's random shuffle already gives us a built-in random. By running the algorithm multiple times
  * on the same data, the hyperedges get shuffled in other places. Which means that when doing the a < b comparison,
  * we don't always have the same hyperedge in a and b.
